# Kruskal's Algorithm Project

## Overview
This project implements **Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm** with both **graphical** and **non-graphical modes**. It is built in **Java (Swing GUI)** for visualizing the algorithmâ€™s steps.  

Kruskal's algorithm is a classic **greedy algorithm** used to find a minimum spanning tree in a weighted, undirected graph. It selects edges in order of increasing weight and adds them to the MST if they do not form a cycle.

## Features
- **Graphical Visualization:**  
  - Original graph and MST are displayed side by side.  
  - Chosen edges are highlighted in green, rejected edges in red.  
  - Step-by-step animation showing the MST construction.  
  - Edge weights and node labels are clearly displayed.  

- **Non-Graphical Mode:**  
  - User can input adjacency matrix.  
  - Algorithm prints chosen and rejected edges with minimum cost.  

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  - Clickable buttons for choosing mode.  
  - Auto-scrolling console for selected/rejected edges.
